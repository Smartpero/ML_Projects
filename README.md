# stock_scraper
Implemented web scraping and exploratory data analysis on stock market data which comprises about more than 80 stock tickers. While HTML web scraping could not be used to scrape text content because of the nature of data, we printed text headers, explored summary statistics of the and visualised he daily stock prices and returns in a histogram plot.

From the Exploratory histogram plot, we can deduce:
- daily closing prices within the range $0 - $1000 had the highest frequecy.
- daily returns rane between 0 - 20% had the highest frequency.

Additonally, the summary statistcis show:
- mean daily closing price of 337.907
